# Hi!

I had a couple hours to kill last night so I thought I'd try to help out with a couple ideas for laying out a multi-track schedule. No hard feelings if it's not what you're looking for; it was a fun exercise and an excuse for me to stay up late coding. I don't get to do that much anymore. <3
