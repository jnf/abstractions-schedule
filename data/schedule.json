Sure, you can use Flow or TypeScript to avoid type errors _most_ of the time, but it's optional and anyone can turn it off whenever they want. Now imagine: never being able to alter data that you shouldn't be able to, lest another part of your application become inconsistent. Yes, you can use Immutable, Mori, or any one of the libraries that exist to provide immutable data structures, but sometimes you'll miss the familiarity and convenience of built-in syntax. Now lastly, imagine the reactivity of a browser environment as a first-class construct. You _could_ use RxJS, Bacon, or Kefyr to get some of that functionality as an additional library, but JavaScript isn't designed around these concepts.\n\nElm provides all of these things and more at the language level. The world's friendliest compiler will guide you toward apps that are expressive and free of runtime errors. Elm's type system and compiler make every step of the development lifecycle enjoyable and allow developers to proceed confidently when refactoring large codebases. _Everything_ in Elm is immutable, from custom record types to familiar data structures like `List` and `Dict`. Elm's `Signal` provides a fundamental focus on reactivity, allowing developers to build their UIs as they truly are: a function of an ever-changing data model. Most importantly, however, it provides all of these things without compromising ease of use. The language was designed with the user in mind, not math, and the community's attitude toward beginners follows suit.\n\nIn this talk I'll demonstrate the raw power of Elm as a browser language and the advantages it provides over even the latest and greatest JavaScript innovations. I'll show code samples and demonstrate the application architecture that arises naturally from the language's constructs. Importantly, though, I'll also speak about the language's community, learning resources, and ecosystem. Elm's creator, Evan Czaplicki, wants the language to push functional programming into the mainstream and the Elm community has rallied behind the friendliness of the language to become amazingly encouraging for new users.","abstract":"Elm is a functional programming language for the web that is designed for approachability. Using Elm we can build browser apps that are free of runtime errors and easy to maintain using functional concepts, but without immense CS knowledge. No runtime errors, no category theory, just great UI code.\n","audience_level":"All"},"speaker":{"name":"Luke Westby","external_image":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/39abd144f7cb92e82d7a67b4c9d15aae?s=500","bio":{"long":"I'm a JavaScript developer at Raise in Chicago, IL, USA with experience on the front-end and in Node.

You’ll learn both principles and practical strategies. For example:\n\n1. **Ask stakeholders about their hopes and fears.** Really. Ask them what gives them anxiety when they think about this project/release/prototype. “What keeps you up at night?” is a good way to phrase this question. Once people get the anxieties out of their heads they’ll feel better, and you’ll know where potential conflict lies.\n\n2. **Talk with stakeholders individually.** Part of the value of these interviews is the signal you send a person by scheduling 30 minutes for the sole purpose of understanding their point of view.  Group interviews are a tempting time-saver, but they aren’t worth it.\n","abstract":"You know that sitcom gimmick where one miscommunication ruins everything?

But how can you elevate a good UX to a great UX?

In this talk, you'll learn through a plethora of examples how much a little bit of attention to micro-interactions can elevate a good UI. Often times, micro-interactions do not serve functional purposes, but are meant to deepen the user engagement with your app by delighting the user through small moments of triggers and feedback. Examples of micro-interactions focus around motion, color, copy, and simplicity. You'll learn how to dissect these types of interactions, so that you too can start adding micro-interactions in your own app. Walk away inspired by the examples and ready to delight your users!","abstract":"So you like your UX, but do you love it?

It's the result of an industry in its awkward twenties; it's identity crisis and it's ego. We aren't fakes, we just don't know how to accurately communicate our skills.

But these tools have their roots in interactive fiction, which stretches back to \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" in 1976. I'd like to give attendees a glimpse into that history, and show them how they can contribute to this art/game form that is still popular even now. Because interactive fiction doesn't rely on graphics or dexterity, it's a fantastic place for people to express their creativity - if you can describe it, it can be part of your game. Inform v7 ties right into that, because its syntax basically is English - you write `The Kitchen is a room inside The House.` and you've just created a new place the player can go to.\n\nParchment is a great JavaScript library that lets you take Inform interactive fiction and embed it into any website. It also gives you hooks (through the Vorple project) that let your Inform application use JavaScript on the page it is running in, meaning you could make interactive agents that do anything the web can do. (Exciting!)","abstract":"Interactive fiction - e.g. \"Zork\" - presents players with deep, engaging experiences using nothing but text. The Web is great with text, and other things, too.

Software development has become a commodity in some managers' eyes, and few companies realize all the things that are required to take a product or service from idea to production and beyond.   Whether you're in a small startup or a big corporation, you've got to get more done in less time to stay ahead of the game.\n\n## Enter Code Generation\nCode generation isn't a new concept, and projects like `yeoman` and `rails` have been using it successfully for years to scaffold a project into a good starting point for you to hone and put into production.   Scaffolding is really only part of the story though.  In this talk I'll show you how to take your code generation skills up to an entirely new level by generating not just a scaffold, but an entire application along with the deployment descriptors (Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests), and documentation (Swagger, apidocs), and any other pieces you need.\n\n## goa - code generation with an easy to use DSL\nThis talk will show you how to use `goa` -- a project that originated as a nice way to generate a JSON API in Go -- to do so much more than generate your API.  You'll see how to create custom generators to create anything you need using a simple to understand and declarative Domain Specific Language.  You'll see how to make your project's `design` DSL idempotent, so that you can make changes to the design and regenerate your project at any time without losing any customizations you've made to the project.  You'll learn how to create a custom DSL for any output that you can dream up.  Perhaps your load balancer requires custom configuration -- using a custom `goa` generator we can build an HAProxy configuration that always stays in sync with your intentions -- because your intentions are stored in your DSL.\n\n## Single Source of Truth\nBy using these concepts you'll be able to make almost your whole infrastructure declarative and versioned in your source code repository.  That concept is called a `Single Source of Truth` and it's the most liberating thing I've ever found in software development.  Using your code as a Single Source of Truth, you'll know that your API Documentation is in sync with what is released in production, because it was generated that way.   You'll never have to worry about your servers being mis-configured during a deployment because that configuration is part of the source code being deployed and _generated by the code being deployed_.\n\n## Now You are 10X\nUsing a DSL to describe your project and all of its outputs means that you can make small changes to your project's design DSL and see a ripple of code generated throughout all the layers of your project.  Much like testing gives you the freedom to refactor with impunity, code generation gives you the freedom to change anything in your stack.  You'll iterate on your projects far faster than you could have previously, with only a small investment up front to create your generators.  You're now 10X.\n","abstract":"Your service or API is your contract with the world.  Unfortunately your documentation, deployment descriptors, test plan and database aren't tied to that contract.  In this talk I'll show you how to generate all of those things, keeping your source code as the Single Source of Truth.\n","audience_level":"Intermediate"},"speaker":{"name":"Brian Ketelsen","external_image":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/75ba8cc30aed7b9df578d98ebdcf8491?s=500","bio":{"long":"Brian Ketelsen is one of the organizers of GopherCon, an annual conference for Go developers and coauthor of the book Go In Action for Manning Press.

Very few of us know where they come from, or what to do when they arrive. Let’s model our feelings like an API and see if it tells us anything. Hint: it does.\n\nImagine you have a public API endpoint which, when called, makes you feel angry. Imagine also that there are thousands of aliases that redirect there. People and situations call any one of those endpoints at any time. It’s up to us to decide what response to send.\n\nWhy would we want to delve into the messy and uncomfortable world of feelings?

So, technologists already have a set of terms that they can use to tackle diversity. They just need to know how to apply those terms in order to effect positive change. These terms are expected behavior, tracing, refactoring, and sample code.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe first step in understanding a bug in knowing the expected behavior of the system. Similarly, understanding diversity is impossible without knowing the expected behavior of technology environments. Whether it's a workplace, conference, or happy hour, the dominant demographic in technology understands and benefits from the behavior patterns they expect from others. However, they often fail to see how underrepresented groups are often denied those benefits. The ability to see these lapses in expected behavior is vital to helping the dominant demographic understand that the key problem behind diversity is a lack of inclusiveness.\n\nTracing\n\nSince software programs are often very complicated, debugging them is often made easier by seeing the output of the underlying code. This is done by tracing which is the practice of displaying lines of code as the program runs. If technologists turn their diversity tracers on, they can see the ways that underrepresented groups are often excluded from information and often exposed to micro-aggressions by the dominant demographic.\n\nRefactoring\n\nWhile the allure of adding new features can be powerful, legacy code is made easier to maintain and less costly to develop by refactoring. This is the practice of restructuring and improving the internal design of code without disrupting the functionality of the system. Diversity refactoring is a good way for technologists to begin making the technology industry a more inclusive one. This is the process of improving the internal structure and design of how underrepresented groups are viewed in tech.\n\nSample Code\n\nOne way to debug code is to see a sample of similar code that runs well. Essentially, another programmer \"lends\" you code that helps your code work better. Just as a person can \"lend\" code to another person, a person can \"lend\" privilege to another person. This can be done by helping underrepresented groups get access to information and events that naturally flow to the dominant demographic in most technology companies.\n\nAttendees of this session will leave with an understanding of the diversity in technology problem that is illuminated by terms that they already know. They will gain techniques that they can immediately put into action for making technology the inclusive environment in which we all deserve to build our careers.","abstract":"The technology sector has struggled with diversity, but we all have a responsibility to make our industry more innovative by becoming more inclusive.

These lingered despite several interface iterations launched to cover alternative use-cases, multiple ownership changes, and funded retirement initiatives. The reason was simple: hundreds of internal and external clients had a dependency on these services. A coordinated migration effort was nearly impossible to prioritize across the whole of Amazon and integrated third-party merchant software.

The 2015 report revealed the critical role that IT leaders play in a company’s DevOps transformation, affirmed that through the power of DevOps and automation, high-performing organizations have 60 percent fewer failures and recover 168 times faster, and demonstrated that DevOps provides a powerful competitive advantage.\n\nThis year, the report will examine new areas including:\n\n* **ROI of IT performance.** Exploring the ROI of IT performance and technical practices to better understand how throughput, stability and quality measures affect the bottom line.\n* **Security and compliance.** Security and compliance are top of mind in the DevOps space. This year’s survey investigates the role security plays in a DevOps environment.\n* **Quality.** Past reports have revealed the impact of DevOps practices on key IT performance metrics for throughput and stability. This year’s survey will help to better understand how quality is affected by DevOps practices.\n* **Containers.** Containers are no doubt changing the IT landscape. The survey will make clear how much containers are truly affecting IT performance.\n* **Lean.** Last year’s report found that lean management practices such as limiting work in process and creating and maintaining visual displays showing key quality and productivity metrics predict IT performance.

People responded well to characters/mascots, images with strong storytelling like comics, and illustrative t-shirt designs.

We think in terms of buttons and grids, fonts and images, touch screens and displays. We might throw in sound effects here and there, but those are just bells and whistles (literally). Why do we largely ignore our devices' microphones and speakers? After all, audio is the modality of choice when it comes to interfacing with each other.\n\nWe have very few examples of consumer-oriented conversational interfaces. In 2016, we can't blame core technology limitations for this deficiency (at least not *completely*). Speech recognition can be accomplished with a web API call, natural-language understanding services are bringing the fruits of machine learning research to the masses, and speech synthesizers no longer sound like robots. You could argue that the tech still has a bit of growing up to do, but Apple II displays only offered 200 monochrome scan-lines and that didn't stop developers from building hundreds of graphical applications for the platform. Thankfully, Oregon Trail was still able to spring into existence.\n\nWe argue that overcoming core technical limitations is only part of the battle. Before this tech can drive the propagation of robust conversational user interfaces (CUIs) into widespread adoption, we need true **CUI frameworks** to provide the scaffolding that GUI frameworks have been providing for a long time. Without proper abstractions, all time and effort is spent on *how* to use the technology to present an interface, rather than the original design concerns of *what* to present.\n\nAs a concrete example of what such a framework could consist of for audio interfaces, we'll discuss SayKit, an iOS SDK created to provide a native framework for CUI development inspired by Apple's own native GUI framework (UIKit). We'll discuss the various design decisions that went into creating SayKit and how we believe it can help foster a new wave of conversational applications. Finally, we'll show a few live examples along with the straightforward code underlying them.\n\nIn particular, the talk will tackle the following topics:\n\n- The promise of conversational UIs\n- Their history (or lack thereof) in consumer applications\n- A UI framework's role in a developer's arsenal\n- Why the existing patchwork of voice services alone cannot fulfill that role\n- How SayKit was built to provide a structured, intuitive, and declarative approach to authoring conversational interfaces","abstract":"When we think about user interfaces, why do we only consider the graphical interface (GUI)?

Even hearing it probably brings back a memory, recent or otherwise, of a time in your career where you simply felt lost. A project ships late, if even at all. An idea you publicly championed doesn't pan out. A coworker earns a deserved promotion that you were also working towards. An MVP crashes and burns.  Someones design is chosen by the team over your own as the one to go with. The ways in which failure can manifest are limitless.\n\nIt's not comfortable to talk about, either.

Localization. Are you ever planning on selling this to someone in another country?\n\n2.  Security. Don't be the organization that has to pay someone for disaster PR. Building in security early saves you a bunch of time and user churn later.\n\n3.  Extensibility. What makes you so sure this API will always be internal?\n\n4.  Documentation. People do not buy software solely based on Powerpoints. You need public docs. The docs have to be more useful than Stack Overflow.\n\n5.  Affordance. UI is not a word. The microtext matters.\n\n6.  Acceptance. Have you shown this to any actual humans who are like the users?\n\n7.  Accessibility. We all use computers different ways. Does your software allow that?\n\n\nI expect this talk will be relevant to both senior people working on leading project teams, and empowering for juniors who don't have a structure for critiquing usability problems.

As soon as these artifacts are created, they quickly become outdated as soon as fingers hit keys and an application morphs and adapts to address problems. Often these updates do not get noted in the documentation. Documents are either abandoned or there is a mad dash to slap together something that is \"good enough.\" When there are multiple sources of documentation (document artifacts, wikis, issue trackers, commit messages, etc), then if the specifications are updated in one place, the specifications are deprecated in others and vice versa.\n\nIdeally, we can maintain a single source of information where people actually interact with and act on the data. Teams primarily interact with and make changes in issue trackers, wikis, and code repositories. Customers may consume document artifacts, but that is ultimately all they are: artifacts.

It draws upon all the lessons learned from a near-decade of using containers at Google.\n\nThere are a number of tools available to spin up containerized environments with Docker on a single host and tear down just as fast. The difficulty is when trying to deploy across two or more servers. Kubernetes is solves just that problem by allowing you to manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system.\n\nSee how to create your own Raspberry Pi cluster to deploy at scale all while demonstrating real chaos monkey failure handling by pulling plugs from random nodes! We’ll also demonstrate different tools to visualize what’s happening in the system through various web interfaces as well as using Minecraft!","abstract":"Show how Kubernetes handles container orchestration, scaling, and a number of failure scenarios gracefully with a real Raspberry Pi computing cluster.

Over the course of three days, we’ll take time to unpack the problem, generate a wide range of ideas, and vote and prioritize solutions so attendees can take actionable items with them.\n\nWe plan to crowd-source these problems, ideas, and solutions by setting up in a prominent location and inviting people to casually stop by and participate. Over the course of a day, or the conference as a whole, attendees could see HCD methods in progress and gain perspective and a working understanding of the process. They can also walk away with some new ideas around the chosen topic that they could use when they go back to work.\n\nGoals of this distraction include:\n*Encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration\n*Observing and participating in HCD methods firsthand\n*Providing actionable strategies for post-conference innovation\n*Opportunities for any and all attendees to participate\n*Creating an interactive way for attendees to meet each other\n\nSee image for further clarification:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxGUjWgfzzWYT09FZmUxV012VEU/view?usp=sharing\n","abstract":"Join us as we use Human-Centered Design methods to inspire all conference attendees to envision innovative solutions around a central theme.

I intend to do so by showing you how variables in memory are laid out in one of my favorite games, Spelunky.\n\nSpelunky is a procedurally-generated platformer game which, behind the scenes, tracks the player’s progress as they play through the game. Using a memory scanner and re-assembler tool called Cheat Engine, we can both view these values and modify these values to make the game easier, make it more difficult, or add new ways to play.\n\nI invite you to come play my modded version of Spelunky and peek under the hood at the values it’s using in memory to construct the world you’re playing in. Once you have a feel for that you can even change those memory values while you’re playing to try out all new styles of play.\n\nI originally became interested in this for the purpose of broadcasting my gameplay, with the intention of automatically generating a display for viewers to see statistics that weren’t normally kept by the game. While I could have just tracked this value by hand, I wanted to see if I could harvest information from the game itself and present it directly to anyone watching. After writing some scripts to track and display those numbers, I found a slew of other values that directly affected the state of the game.\n\nI’ll be sharing the techniques that I used to explore the game’s memory. My goal is to give you a fundamental knowledge of memory introspection tools which you can use to dig into and augment your favorite game or program. I hope you are inspired to go explore, modify, and break!","abstract":"A live demo where you can edit video games as you play them.
